Created Files:

1. src/modules/mailer.ts - TypeScript version of the mailer module with:

   - Proper TypeScript imports and typing
   - All four email functions: registration confirmation, password reset, video montage complete, and join squad

notifications - Correct template paths pointing to src/templates/ 2. src/routes/users.ts - TypeScript version of user routes with: - User registration endpoint with password hashing, email sending, and pending invitations handling - User login endpoint with password validation and JWT token generation - Proper TypeScript types for Request/Response - Import of database models from kybervision20db package 3.

- Template Path Updates: Corrected paths to use src/templates/ instead of just templates/

The application now has fully functional user registration and login endpoints at:

- POST /users/register
- POST /users/login

Both endpoints work with the KyberVision20Db models and include email functionality using the HTML templates in
src/templates/.

## Implemented app.ts and onStartUp.ts (commit bd4c1611977b20d1f8c09e4d3ac688657e543eed - lost)

- Null Safety: Added filtering for undefined environment variables
- Error Handling: Maintained the same error handling patterns as the JavaScript version
- Modern Imports: Used ES6 import syntax throughout

The application now has proper startup initialization that will create necessary directories, set up default data, and
create admin users when the server starts up, just like the original JavaScript version but with TypeScript type
safety.

## Modifs to app.ts added cors and morgan (commit eb922f34a441d655571707a0da1e48108322e19e - lost )

2. **League Association** - Links team to league (defaults to General League if none specified)
3. **User Permissions** - Automatically grants creator admin and super user privileges
4. **Player Creation** - Processes players array and creates player records with team associations
5. **Response Enhancement** - Returns teamNew object with playersArray included for client reference

**Player Management:**

- **Player Creation** - Creates player records with optional shirt numbers, positions
- **Team Association** - Links players to teams via ContractTeamPlayer relationship
- **Player Removal** - Removes player-team associations while preserving player records
- **Return Enhancement** - Returns player object with teamId included (not stored in Player table)

### Key Fixes:

- **Multi-Video Support** - Supports actions linked to different videos via ContractVideoAction relationships

### Key TypeScript Fixes:

**ContractVideoActions Association Handling:**

- **Problem**: TypeScript didn't recognize `ContractVideoActions` as a property since it's a Sequelize association
- **Solution**: Cast `action.toJSON()` to `any` type to access included association data

```typescript
const actionJSON = action.toJSON() as any;
const { ContractVideoActions, ...actionWithoutContractVideoActions } =
	actionJSON;
```

**Timestamp Arithmetic Type Issues:**

- **Problem**: TypeScript couldn't perform arithmetic operations on timestamp fields
- **Solution**: Convert timestamps to numbers using `new Date().getTime()` before performing calculations

```typescript
const actionTimestamp = new Date(
	actionWithoutContractVideoActions.timestamp
).getTime();
const referenceTimestamp = new Date(
	scriptsArray[i].timestampReferenceFirstAction
).getTime();
const differenceInTime = (actionTimestamp - referenceTimestamp) / 1000;
```

### Database Relationship Handling:

- **Multiple ContractVideoActions**: Properly handles the fact that each Action can have multiple corresponding rows in the ContractVideoActions table
- **Association Filtering**: Finds the correct ContractVideoAction for a specific video using `ContractVideoActions.find()`
- **Safe Array Access**: Uses optional chaining and fallback values for robust data handling

### TypeScript Improvements:

- **Cross-Reference Checks** - Validates player status across ContractTeamPlayer and ContractPlayerUser tables
- **Enhanced Squad Data** - Returns comprehensive squad member information with player associations

### Key TypeScript Fixes:

**Sequelize Association Access Issues:**

- **Problem**: TypeScript couldn't access Team and User associations directly from ContractTeamUser instances
- **Solution**: Cast `toJSON()` result to `any` type to access included association data

```typescript
const ctuJSON = ctu.toJSON() as any;
const { Team, ...ctuData } = ctuJSON;
```

**Include Structure Type Errors:**

- **Problem**: TypeScript required array format for Sequelize include with nested associations
- **Solution**: Wrap include objects in arrays for proper typing

```typescript
include: [
	{
		model: User,
		attributes: ["id", "username", "email"],
		include: [
			{
				model: ContractPlayerUser,
			},
		],
	},
];
```

**Parameter Type Conversions:**

- **Problem**: Route parameters come as strings but database expects numbers for teamId
- **Solution**: Convert string parameters to numbers consistently

```typescript
const teamId = Number(req.params.teamId);
```

**Null Safety for Associations:**

- **Problem**: Team associations could be null causing runtime errors
- **Solution**: Added null checks with proper error handling and filtering

```typescript
if (!team) {
	console.log(
		"Warning: Team association not found for ContractTeamUser",
		ctu.id
	);
	return null;
}
```

### Database Relationship Handling:

- **Modern Imports** - ES6 import syntax throughout
- **Error Handling** - Enhanced error handling with typed error objects and logging
- **Authentication** - All endpoints protected with JWT authentication middleware
- **Naming Correction** - Fixed from singular `contractTeamUser` to plural `contractTeamUsers` for consistency

The contractTeamUsers API now provides complete team membership management functionality including user invitations, role management, join token systems, and squad member administration, all with proper TypeScript type safety and authentication.

- **Solution**: Convert string timestamps to Date objects for both script and action creation

```typescript
// Script creation
timestampReferenceFirstAction: new Date(earliestTimestamp);

// Action creation
const actionObj = {
	...elem,
	scriptId,
	timestamp: new Date(elem.timestamp),
};

interface ActionData {
	timestamp: string;
	favorite?: boolean;
	[key: string]: any;
}
```

### Fixes required due to Google APIs TypeScript

What we changed and why it's causing new errors:

1. "strict": true - This enabled ALL strict type checking options, which is much more rigorous than before
2. "target": "ES2017" - This is actually modern (ES2017 = ES8, released in 2017)
3. "skipLibCheck": true - This helps with the Google APIs issue by skipping type checking of declaration files

The real issue:

The "strict": true flag is now catching type safety issues that were previously ignored. This includes:

- Stricter null/undefined checking
- Stricter property assignment checking
- Stricter function parameter checking

### Summary of fixes applied:

Proper Error Handling (Your Preferred Approach):

- videos.ts: Added validation to return proper error messages when video.filename is null/undefined
- routes/videos.ts: Added filename validation in montage job queuing

Required Field Additions:

- onStartUp.ts: Added required firstName and lastName fields for admin user creation
- players.ts: Added fallback empty string for optional lastName parameter

Null Safety:

- sessions.ts: Added null coalescing for timestampReferenceFirstAction fields
- modules/sessions.ts: Added type casting for flexible session creation

Type Casting for Complex Models:

- scripts.ts: Used as any casting for Action creation with dynamic properties

Dependencies:

- Installed @types/json2csv and @types/unzipper for proper TypeScript support

Key Benefits of These Fixes:

1. Better Error Messages: Users now get meaningful error messages instead of silent failures
2. Type Safety: Strict mode catches real bugs and ensures data integrity
3. Null Safety: Prevents runtime errors from null/undefined values
4. Modern TypeScript: We maintained ES2017 target and strict typing for better code quality

The TypeScript strict mode is now helping us write more robust, type-safe code while providing better error handling for end users. All
compilation errors are resolved and the codebase is now more maintainable and reliable!
